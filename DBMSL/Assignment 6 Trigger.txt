The SQL code you shared showcases practical examples of triggers and audit tables in relational database management. These concepts fall under the broader database management theory and are used for maintaining data integrity, ensuring accountability, and tracking changes. Let's break down the key components and relate them to database theory.

Key Concepts and Theories
Databases and Tables

Databases: In relational database systems like MySQL, a database is a structured collection of data. Here, you're working with a database named te31475_db.
Tables: Tables store data in rows and columns. For example, the Library table holds book details like book_name and available_copies.
Triggers

Definition: A trigger is a set of actions that are automatically executed (triggered) in response to certain events on a table, such as INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE. Triggers are used to enforce rules or maintain an audit trail.
Before and After Triggers: You created both BEFORE and AFTER triggers.
BEFORE UPDATE/DELETE: These triggers insert the old values into an Audit table before an update or delete operation occurs in the Library table.
AFTER UPDATE/DELETE: These triggers record data after the operation is complete, helping ensure that both the previous and updated state of the data are tracked.
Practical Use: Triggers are important in scenarios where you want to maintain an audit trail, apply complex validation rules, or log changes automatically without having to write additional application-level logic.
Audit Table

Audit Tables: The Library_Audit table stores historical changes made to the Library table. Audit tables are crucial for data logging and tracking changes over time. They record:
book_id (to know which book's data was modified).
old_book_name and old_available_copies (to track the previous state of the data).
action (whether it was an UPDATE, DELETE, etc.).
change_date (to know when the action took place).
Purpose: Audit tables help organizations meet compliance and regulatory requirements by maintaining a record of every significant action. They also assist in debugging, as they allow tracing of changes.
Primary Keys and Auto-Increment

Primary Keys: In relational databases, a primary key is a unique identifier for records in a table. Both Library and Library_Audit tables have auto-incrementing primary keys (id and audit_id respectively).
Auto-Increment: This is a mechanism to automatically generate unique keys when new records are inserted.
Normalization and Data Integrity

Normalization: The design of the Library and Library_Audit tables reflects the principle of normalization, which involves organizing data to reduce redundancy and dependency. Each table is responsible for one entity (Library for books, and Library_Audit for historical data).
Data Integrity: Triggers ensure that data changes are tracked automatically, helping maintain the integrity and reliability of the system.
Relevant Theoretical Concepts
Event-Driven Programming in Databases: Triggers are a form of event-driven programming where the database automatically responds to events like UPDATE or DELETE.
ACID Properties: Triggers and audits support ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) properties by ensuring consistency in the database after updates or deletes.
Change Data Capture (CDC): Your example relates to a common design pattern known as Change Data Capture, where changes to the main data are logged in a separate table for future reference or analysis.
In summary, this practical SQL code implements core database principles such as data auditing, automatic event handling with triggers, and maintaining historical data for accountability and data integrity.

Database Triggers: Theory and Concepts
A trigger is a procedural code in a database that is automatically executed (or fired) when a specific event occurs on a table or view. Triggers are a core feature of many relational database management systems (RDBMS), such as MySQL, Oracle, SQL Server, and PostgreSQL. They are particularly useful for enforcing data integrity, auditing changes, and automating actions in response to specific events.

1. Definition and Purpose of Triggers
A trigger is a database object that is associated with a table and is activated upon the occurrence of a specified event (e.g., INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE). Its main purpose is to automate certain database functions, ensuring that specific tasks are performed automatically when data is modified in the database.

Automation: Triggers can automatically check or enforce business rules without needing application-level logic.
Data Integrity: Triggers help maintain the integrity of the data by ensuring that related actions are taken automatically when records are added, updated, or deleted.
Auditing and Logging: Triggers can be used to log changes made to a table (inserting old and new values into an audit table).
2. Types of Triggers
Triggers are typically categorized based on timing (when they are executed) and event type (what action triggers them).

Timing:

BEFORE Trigger: Executes before the event (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE) is completed. These are often used to validate or modify data before it is written to the database.
AFTER Trigger: Executes after the event is completed. Typically used for logging, auditing, or maintaining historical records.
Event Type:

INSERT Trigger: Fired when a new record is inserted into the table.
UPDATE Trigger: Fired when an existing record is updated.
DELETE Trigger: Fired when a record is deleted.
3. Syntax and Structure of a Trigger
The general syntax of a trigger involves defining the event (like an INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE) and specifying whether it should run before or after the event. Here’s the structure:

sql
Copy code
CREATE TRIGGER trigger_name
BEFORE | AFTER INSERT | UPDATE | DELETE
ON table_name
FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
    -- Action to be performed
END;
trigger_name: The name of the trigger.
BEFORE | AFTER: Specifies when the trigger is executed (before or after the event).
INSERT | UPDATE | DELETE: Specifies the type of event that activates the trigger.
table_name: The table on which the trigger is applied.
FOR EACH ROW: Specifies that the trigger is fired for each row affected by the event.
4. Use Cases for Triggers
Triggers are applied in various situations to automate database operations. Common use cases include:

Enforcing Business Rules: For example, a trigger can be set to prevent inserting data that violates certain constraints (e.g., ensuring that the salary of an employee cannot exceed a certain limit).
Data Integrity: A trigger can be used to maintain data consistency across related tables. For instance, when deleting a record in one table, related records in another table can be automatically removed to prevent orphaned data.
Auditing: Triggers can log changes made to sensitive data by writing historical records to an audit table (as demonstrated in your example). This allows tracking who modified a record and what changes were made.
Derived Columns: Triggers can be used to calculate and update derived or computed columns in a table. For example, you might create a trigger to automatically calculate a total_price field by multiplying quantity by unit_price.
5. Advantages of Triggers
Automatic Execution: Triggers are fired automatically, which means developers don't need to write additional code in applications to perform routine checks, updates, or logging.
Enforced Consistency: Triggers can enforce consistency between tables (e.g., cascading updates or deletes) or ensure that data is valid before being inserted or modified.
Auditing and Security: Triggers allow for real-time auditing of database operations. This can be useful for tracking changes in sensitive tables, ensuring compliance with regulations, or identifying unauthorized modifications.
6. Limitations and Considerations
While triggers are powerful, there are some limitations and potential issues to consider:

Performance Overhead: Triggers add overhead to the database, especially if they perform complex operations or are invoked frequently. For instance, triggers that fire on every row of a large UPDATE operation may slow down performance.
Complexity: The use of many triggers can lead to increased complexity, making it harder to understand or debug the behavior of the database.
Hidden Logic: Because triggers operate behind the scenes, their actions may not be immediately visible to developers or users, leading to confusion if unexpected changes occur.
Cascading Triggers: A trigger that initiates another trigger (cascading triggers) can lead to unexpected behavior or even infinite loops. Most databases provide safeguards to prevent this.
7. Examples of Triggers
Example 1: Logging an Update

sql
Copy code
CREATE TRIGGER log_update
BEFORE UPDATE ON employees
FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
    INSERT INTO employee_log (employee_id, old_salary, new_salary, change_date)
    VALUES (OLD.employee_id, OLD.salary, NEW.salary, NOW());
END;
This trigger logs changes made to an employee’s salary into a log table before the update takes effect.

Example 2: Cascade Delete

sql
Copy code
CREATE TRIGGER delete_orders
AFTER DELETE ON customers
FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
    DELETE FROM orders WHERE customer_id = OLD.customer_id;
END;
In this case, whenever a customer is deleted from the customers table, all their corresponding orders in the orders table are automatically removed.

8. Best Practices for Using Triggers
Use Sparingly: Triggers can add hidden complexity. Use them judiciously, only when necessary.
Keep Triggers Simple: Triggers should perform minimal and well-defined tasks to avoid performance problems and increase maintainability.
Document Trigger Behavior: Because triggers operate automatically, it’s essential to document their purpose, behavior, and any potential side effects to avoid confusion later on.
Avoid Business Logic in Triggers: While triggers can enforce some rules, more complex business logic is better handled in the application layer where it can be more transparent and easier to manage.
Conclusion
Triggers are a powerful feature in relational databases that allow automatic execution of actions based on changes to data. While they offer significant benefits in automating tasks, enforcing data integrity, and logging changes, their potential for adding complexity and performance overhead should be carefully considered.

Here’s a comparison of AFTER and BEFORE triggers in tabular form, highlighting their differences with examples.

Criteria	BEFORE Trigger	AFTER Trigger
Execution Timing	Executes before the event (INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE) happens.	Executes after the event (INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE) happens.
Primary Use Case	Typically used for validation or modification of data before it is inserted, updated, or deleted.	Used for actions that need to happen after data is committed, like logging or updating related data.
Can Modify Data?	Yes, you can modify the values being inserted/updated.	No, the changes have already been committed, so data cannot be altered at this point.
Error Handling	Errors or failures in the trigger can prevent the event from happening.	Errors in the trigger won't affect the original operation (as the change has already been committed).
Performance Impact	May increase the time it takes to perform the event, as data validation or modification occurs before the event completes.	Slightly better for performance-sensitive operations, as it executes after the event and doesn't block it.
When to Use	Use when you need to ensure data consistency or validation before data changes are committed.	Use when you need to log, audit, or perform actions dependent on successful completion of the event.
Example	Example of BEFORE trigger to ensure book quantity is positive before updating:
sql CREATE TRIGGER before_update_library <br> BEFORE UPDATE ON Library <br> FOR EACH ROW <br> BEGIN <br> IF NEW.available_copies < 0 THEN <br> SIGNAL SQLSTATE '45000' <br> SET MESSAGE_TEXT = 'Negative copies not allowed'; <br> END IF; <br> END;	Example of AFTER trigger to log changes into an audit table after an update:
sql CREATE TRIGGER after_update_library <br> AFTER UPDATE ON Library <br> FOR EACH ROW <br> BEGIN <br> INSERT INTO Library_Audit (book_id, old_book_name, old_available_copies, action) <br> VALUES (NEW.id, NEW.book_name, NEW.available_copies, 'UPDATED AFTER'); <br> END;
Key Differences:
BEFORE Trigger: Executes before the event, can validate or modify the data, and can prevent the event from happening if conditions are not met.
AFTER Trigger: Executes after the event, often used for logging or auditing actions, and cannot modify data.
This structured comparison helps clarify when and how to use each type of trigger.
